Pigeons are my favorite bird and my socks rarely match.
When they do, something is generally amiss.

Here are some places I've photographed pigeons:
* Montpellier, France
* New York City
* Asheville, NC

Here are some socks I have worn: 
* knee-high with Wonder Woman capes
* medium length with planets and stars and the words "SPACE CADET"
* short with the green M&M

Here is a picture of a pitcher with clouds in it.
